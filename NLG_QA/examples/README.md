# Question answering

This folder contains several scripts that showcase how to fine-tune a ðŸ¤— Transformers model on a question answering dataset,
like SQuAD. 


### Fine-tuning BERT on SQuAD1.0

The [`run_qa.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/pytorch/question-answering/run_qa.py) script
allows to fine-tune any model from our [hub](https://huggingface.co/models) (as long as its architecture has a `ForQuestionAnswering` version in the library) on a question-answering dataset (such as SQuAD, or any other QA dataset available in the `datasets` library, or your own csv/jsonlines files) as long as they are structured the same way as SQuAD. You might need to tweak the data processing inside the script if your data is structured differently.

**Note:** This script only works with models that have a fast tokenizer (backed by the ðŸ¤— Tokenizers library) as it
uses special features of those tokenizers. You can check if your favorite model has a fast tokenizer in
[this table](https://huggingface.co/transformers/index.html#supported-frameworks), if it doesn't you can still use the old version of the script which can be found [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/legacy/question-answering).

Note that if your dataset contains samples with no possible answers (like SQuAD version 2), you need to pass along the flag `--version_2_with_negative`.

This example code fine-tunes BERT on the SQuAD1.0 dataset. It runs in 24 min (with BERT-base) or 68 min (with BERT-large)
on a single tesla V100 16GB.

```bash
python run_qa.py \
  --model_name_or_path bert-base-uncased \
  --dataset_name squad \
  --do_train \
  --do_eval \
  --per_device_train_batch_size 12 \
  --learning_rate 3e-5 \
  --num_train_epochs 2 \
  --max_seq_length 384 \
  --doc_stride 128 \
  --output_dir /tmp/debug_squad/
```


#### Command for SQuAD2.0:

```bash
export SQUAD_DIR=/path/to/SQUAD

python run_qa_beam_search.py \
    --model_name_or_path xlnet-large-cased \
    --dataset_name squad_v2 \
    --do_train \
    --do_eval \
    --version_2_with_negative \
    --learning_rate 3e-5 \
    --num_train_epochs 4 \
    --max_seq_length 384 \
    --doc_stride 128 \
    --output_dir ./wwm_cased_finetuned_squad/ \
    --per_device_eval_batch_size=2  \
    --per_device_train_batch_size=2   \
    --save_steps 5000
```
